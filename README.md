This was a fun experiment which I executed with the help of ChatGPT.
Me and my friend were discussing one day, that how skewed is the wealth distribution in India, or also in the world.
There are some people people with a lot of money and many people with less money.
That got me to thinking, is it natural? Is it bound to happen given enough time? 
Like, if we start from a perfectly balanced wealth distribution in a population, will it eventually reach a skewed distribution as the time passes.
I wanted to answer this question, hence ran a simulation to see what happens.
